[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/strubell/jflex-scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/strubell/jflex-scala)

This is the jflex-scala git repository, a fork of [JFlex](http://jflex.de) that can also emit Scala. 

An example of its use (including the Maven plugin) can be found here: [FACTORIE](https://github.com/factorie/factorie).

To emit Scala rather than Java at the command line, simply use the `--scala` argument with the jflex script.

The toplevel contains:

 * jflex-scala, the scanner/lexer generator for Java/Scala
 * the jflex-scala maven plugin
 * the JFlex unicode maven plugin
 * the regression test suite for JFlex
 * the LaTeX sources for the user manual

For documentation and more information about JFlex see its website at [http://jflex.de](http://jflex.de)

JFlex-scala is free software, contributions are welcome.
See the file [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.
